# NAME

tsv-to-csv - convert TSV to CSV

# SYNOPSIS

tsv-to-csv OPTIONS 

# DESCRIPTION

Read a TSV file from standard input and write the corresponding CSV file to standard output.

In the TSV format fields are delimited by tabs and records are terminated by an end-of-line marker.

There is no mechanism for quoting tabs or newlines, and by default `csv-to-tsv` will fail if they occur in the fields of the CSV file.  

# OPTIONS

-d DELIMITER, \--delimiter=DELIMITER
: Used to read CSV files which use DELIMITER to separate fields instead of a comma.

-q QUOTECHAR, \--quotechar=QUOTECHAR
: Used to read CSV files which use QUOTECHAR to quote fields instead of double quotes.

-u, \--unescape
: Interpret the following backslash sequences when encountered in the data: \n, \r, \t, \\.
